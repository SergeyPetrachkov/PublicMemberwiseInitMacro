# PublicMemberwiseInitMacro

First tryout of the new Macros API in Swift

## Prerequisites

* Xcode 15 Beta and higher (to have the template in the IDE and dev tools in the system)
* Swift 5.9
* Free time

Open Package.swift and let it load all the dependencies.
You'll find a tests target (nice for debugging purposes) and a client (which is a dummy console app).
All the magic happens inside `PublicMemberwiseInitMacro` struct.
